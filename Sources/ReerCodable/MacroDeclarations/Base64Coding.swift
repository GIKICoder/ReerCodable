/// The `@Base64Coding` macro that provides automatic Base64 encoding and decoding functionality.
///
/// This macro can be applied to properties of type `Data` or `[UInt8]` to automatically handle
/// Base64 string conversion during encoding and decoding:
/// - When decoding: converts Base64 encoded strings to `Data` or `[UInt8]`
/// - When encoding: converts `Data` or `[UInt8]` to Base64 encoded strings
///
/// Example usage:
/// ```swift
/// @Codable
/// struct User {
///     @Base64Coding
///     var data: Data?          // Stored as Base64 string in JSON
///
///     @Base64Coding
///     var bytes: [UInt8]?      // Stored as Base64 string in JSON
/// }
/// ```
///
/// The macro can be combined with other property wrappers like `@CodingKey`:
/// ```swift
/// @CodingKey("data.data2")
/// @Base64Coding
/// var data2: Data?
/// ```
