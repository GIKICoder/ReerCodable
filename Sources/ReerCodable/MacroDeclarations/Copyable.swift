/// A macro that automatically generates copying functionality for types.
///
/// The `@Copyable` macro generates two types of copy methods depending on the type:
///
/// 1. For classes and structs:
/// - Generates a `copy()` method with optional parameters for all properties
/// - Allows partial property updates during copying
/// - For classes, creates a new instance with different memory address
///
/// 2. For enums
/// - Generates a simple `copy()` method that returns self
///
/// # Examples:
///
/// ## Struct Example:
/// ```swift
/// @Codable
/// @Copyable
/// struct Model {
///     var name: String
///     let id: Int
///     var desc: String?
/// }
///
/// // Generated methods:
/// // func copy(name: String? = nil, id: Int? = nil, desc: String? = nil) -> Model
///
/// let model = Model(name: "phoenix", id: 123, desc: "Swift Developer")
/// let copy1 = model.copy()  // Full copy
/// let copy2 = model.copy(name: "new name")  // Partial update
/// ```
///
/// ## Generic Class Example:
/// ```swift
/// @Codable
/// @Copyable
/// class Model<Element: Codable> {
///     var name: String
///     var data: Element?
/// }
///
/// // Generated methods maintain generic constraints
/// // Creates new instance with different memory address
/// ```
///
/// ## Enum Example:
/// ```swift
/// @Codable
/// @Copyable
/// enum Season {
///     case spring, summer, fall, winter
/// }
///
/// // Generates simple copy method returning self
/// ```
///
/// # Features:
/// - Supports both mutable and immutable properties
/// - Handles optional and non-optional types
/// - Preserves generic type constraints
/// - Creates true copies for reference types (different memory addresses)
/// - Supports partial property updates
///
/// # Requirements:
/// - Must be used with `@Codable` macro
/// - Properties must be copyable
/// - For generic types, type parameters must conform to Codable
///
/// # Usage Notes:
/// - For structs and classes, generated copy methods allow updating specific properties
/// - For classes, each copy creates a new instance (different memory address)
/// - For enums, simply returns self
/// - All properties are optional parameters in copy method
///
